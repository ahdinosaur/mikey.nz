As my precursor to [arthack.nz](https://arthack.nz), I was part of a group during my uni years in Berkeley, California, USA: "Multimedia Orchestra @Berkeley", aka MOB.

It was a relaxed group of creative tech geeks, who met regularly to jam on the latest creative obsessions, either in music, art, tech, and/or everything in between and around.

TODO: Are there any recordings still available?

I made a [RepRap Prusa Mendel](https://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel_(iteration_1)), from a kit from [MakerGear](https://https://makergear.com/).

<https://web.archive.org/web/20120621070425/http://www.makergear.com/products/3d-printers>

I went to the Bay Area Maker Faire and found some 3d printer enthusiasts: I asked "should I buy a 3d printer or build a 3d printer?". They responded: "if you want to print, buy a 3d printer; if you want the focus to be the printer itself, build a 3d printer." So for better or worse, after that I bought a kit to build a 3d printer.

I remember spending the north-summer of 2012 building this kit with a friend (Michael). This overlaps with my [Hacker Cooperative obsession](/projects/hackercoop)

After [dotfiles](/projects/dotfiles) on Ubuntu then Arch Linux, I jumped into hardcore mode: Gentoo with CfEngine3.

Here's some artifacts from that journey:

- [`command-center`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/command-center)
- [`blue-dream-masterfiles`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/blue-dream-masterfiles)
- [`bootstraps`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/bootstraps)
- [`dinolay`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/dinolay)

They say you have to hit rock bottom before youâ€™re ready to change an addiction. Maybe this was my rock bottom with Linux, as after this I switched to Debian and I've mostly stayed there since. Next up was [dino-puppet](/projects/dino-puppet).

My first personal configuration on GitHub: [`ahdinosaur/dotfiles`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/dotfiles/).

You could see at the time I was using:

- Ubuntu Linux as the operating system
- vim for text editing
- zsh for shell
- irssi for IRC
- mutt for email

I then transitioned to [`ahdinosaur/dot`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/dot) using Arch Linux.

Was superseded by [dotengine](/projects/dotengine) using CfEngine3 on Gentoo.

My first project on GitHub: [`ahdinosaur/hackercoop`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/hackercoop/).

we need to make the business plan for it.

> Decentralize production!
>
> Planning is on the wiki: <https://github.com/ahdinosaur/hackercoop/wiki>.

This was the first in my "Omega" project towards [peer production](TODO).

This overlaps with me [building a RepRap Prusa Mendel 3d printer](/projects/reprap-prusa-mendel).
