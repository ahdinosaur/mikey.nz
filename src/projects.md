My first personal configuration on GitHub: [`ahdinosaur/dotfiles`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/dotfiles/).

You could see at the time I was using:

- Ubuntu Linux as the operating system
- vim for text editing
- zsh for shell
- irssi for IRC
- mutt for email

I then transitioned to [`ahdinosaur/dot`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/dot) using Arch Linux.

Was superseded by [dotengine](/projects/dotengine) using CfEngine3 on Gentoo.

My first project on GitHub: [`ahdinosaur/hackercoop`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/hackercoop/).

we need to make the business plan for it.

Nothing tangible came of this project, but was the first in my "Omega" project towards [peer production](TODO).
