At the end of my life in [Cloyne Court Hotel and Casino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloyne_Court_Hotel), a house of 150 people living under one roof (with one kitchen, one dining room, many many bedrooms, etc), Cloyne became under threat from the Berkeley Student Cooperative, who wanted to make an example of the house for something that occurred many years ago (before anyone living in the house was present).

I used my web development skills to fight back: [savecloyne.come](https://web.archive.org/web/20150712230038/http://savecloyne.com/)

From that time, this video still gives me goosebumps: ["Our Port In Any Storm"](https://vimeo.com/showcase/2783829?video=88628686)

For 2 years while I lived at [Cloyne Court Hotel and Casino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloyne_Court_Hotel), a house of 150 people living under one roof (with one kitchen, one dining room, many many bedrooms, etc), I was the "Network Manager" in charge of making sure everyone had sufficient internet.

As my precursor to [arthack.nz](https://arthack.nz), I was part of a group during my uni years in Berkeley, California, USA: "Multimedia Orchestra @Berkeley", aka MOB.

It was a relaxed group of creative tech geeks, who met regularly to jam on the latest creative obsessions, either in music, art, tech, and/or everything in between and around.

TODO: Are there any recordings still available?

I made a [RepRap Prusa Mendel](https://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel_(iteration_1)), from a kit from [MakerGear](https://https://makergear.com/).

<https://web.archive.org/web/20120621070425/http://www.makergear.com/products/3d-printers>

I went to the Bay Area Maker Faire and found some 3d printer enthusiasts: I asked "should I buy a 3d printer or build a 3d printer?". They responded: "if you want to print, buy a 3d printer; if you want the focus to be the printer itself, build a 3d printer." So for better or worse, after that I bought a kit to build a 3d printer.

I remember spending the north-summer of 2012 building this kit with a friend (Michael). This overlaps with my [Hacker Cooperative obsession](/projects/hackercoop)

After [dotfiles](/projects/dotfiles) on Ubuntu then Arch Linux, I jumped into hardcore mode: Gentoo with CfEngine3.

Here's some artifacts from that journey:

- [`command-center`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/command-center)
- [`blue-dream-masterfiles`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/blue-dream-masterfiles)
- [`bootstraps`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/bootstraps)
- [`dinolay`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/dinolay)

They say you have to hit rock bottom before youâ€™re ready to change an addiction. Maybe this was my rock bottom with Linux, as after this I switched to Debian and I've mostly stayed there since. Next up was [dino-puppet](/projects/dino-puppet).

My first personal configuration on GitHub: [`ahdinosaur/dotfiles`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/dotfiles/).

You could see at the time I was using:

- Ubuntu Linux as the operating system
- vim for text editing
- zsh for shell
- irssi for IRC
- mutt for email

Then I experimented with the concept of "bricks":

I then transitioned to [`ahdinosaur/dot`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/dot) using Arch Linux.

Was superseded by [dotengine](/projects/dotengine) using CfEngine3 on Gentoo.

My first project on GitHub: [`ahdinosaur/hackercoop`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/hackercoop/).

we need to make the business plan for it.

This was the first in my "Omega" project towards [peer production](TODO).

This later overlaps with me [building a RepRap Prusa Mendel 3d printer](/projects/reprap-prusa-mendel).
